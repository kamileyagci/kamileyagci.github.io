## Overview

In this project, I have analyzed the Movie Industry. The Microsoft decided to open a new studio and is exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The results of this study will advise Microsoft on making business decisions.

## Business Problem

I have studied the four questions in order to determine the most profitable approach in movie making: 

1. Is there a correlation between the production budget and the profit?
2. Is there a correlation between the ratings and the profit?
3. Which directors, writers, actors and actresses make the most profit?
4. Which genres make the most profit?

## Data

Based on the selected Business Problems, I used the data from IMDB and The Numbers in the analysis. 

* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

The data files are:

* tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
* imdb.title.basics.csv.gz
* imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz
* imdb.title.principals.csv.gz
* imdb.name.basics.csv.gz

## Method

**Part I**

1. Explore all the provided Movie Industry Data Files from IMDB, The Numbers, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo, TheMovieDB.

2. Determine the Business Questions.

3. Select which Data Files to be used in the Analysis: 5 data files selected from IMDB and The Numbers.

4. Merge Data into one DataFrame.

4. Clean Data
    * Remove the unnecessary columns
    * Remove rows with $0 worldwide_gross
    * Change the currency columns to float
    * Seperate genres
    * Slice the release year from the release date

5. Create Profit Columns

    Two types of profit is defined for this study:
    * Profit: profit_gross =  worldwide_gross - production_budget
    * Profit Rate: profit_rate = worldwide_gross / production_budget

6. Save the created DataFrame into a a new data file 'myData.csv'. This is the only data file be used for the analysis.

**Part II**

7. Analyse Business Question 1: Is there a correlation between the production budget and the profit?
    * Create a subset of the data with the selected/required columns for Question 1 and Question 2.
    * Filter data specifed for Question 1 & 2:
        * Remove duplicate movies.
        * Remove old movies with release year before 1990; focus on past 30 years.
        * Remove outlier movies with very low budget (<$10,000,000) and very high profit rate (>30). 
    * Data Visualization and Correlation Calculation: Scatter Plots for 'Profit vs Production Budget' and 'Profit Rate vs Production Rate'
    * Detailed look at the ''Profit vs Production Budget' at different budget ranges: Data Visualization, Correlation and Median profit Rate.

8. Analyse Business Question 2: Is there a correlation between the ratings and the profit?
    * Use the subset of the data created for Business Question 1.
    * Data Visualization and Correlation Calculation: Scatter 'Profit vs Average Rating' and 'Profit Rate vs Average Rating'.

9. Analyse Business Question 3: Which directors and writers make the most profit?
    * Create a subset of the data with the selected/required columns for Question 3.
    * Filter data specifed for Question 3:
        * Remove duplicate movies.
        * Remove old movies with release year before 1990; focus on past 30 years.
        * Remove the names of the dead people.
        * Select the high budget movies (production_budget > $100,000,000). This selection is based on the analysis for Question 1. 
    * Most Profitable Directors:
        * Remove the directors with less than 2 movies 
        * GroupBy Directors and calculate the median Profit and median Profit Rate
        * Data Visualization: Bar Graphs for Profit and Profit Rate. Top names will be displayed only. 
        * Find the intersection of the names on the two lists/bar graphs: Profit and Profit Rate.
    * Most Profitable Writers:
        Apply the same analysis as directors.
    * Most Profitable Actors:
        Apply the same analysis as directors.
    * Most Profitable Actresses:
        Apply the same analysis as directors.

10. Analyse Business Question 4: Which genres make the most profit?
    * Create a subset of the data with the selected/required columns for Question 4.
    * Filter data specifed for Question 4:
        * Remove duplicate movies.
        * Remove old movies with release year before 1990; focus on past 30 years.
        * Select the high budget movies (production_budget > $100,000,000). This selection is based on the analysis for Question 1. 
    * GroupBy Genres and calculate the median Profit and median Profit Rate. 
    * Data Visualization: Bar Graphs for Profit and Profit Rate. Common genres with large number of movies will be displayed only. 
    * Visually determine the most profitable names based on two bar graphs: Profit and Profit Rate.

**Part III**

11. Repeat the analysis for Question 3 'Most profitable directors, writers, actors and actresses' for Movies with Medium Budget ($20,000,000 < production_budget > $100,000,000).

12. Repeat the analysis for Question 4 'Most profitable genres' for Movies with Medium Budget ($20,000,000 < production_budget > $100,000,000).


## Analysis and Results

My analysis and business questions focus on the factors affecting the profit in movie industry. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good definition of the profit. Instead of using only one profit definition, I chose to explore two definitions:

* Profit: profit_gross =  worldwide_gross - production_budget
* Profit Rate: profit_rate = worldwide_gross / production_budget

In this study, for each business question, I will look at both 'Profit' and 'Profit Rate' distributions.

### Q1: Is there a correlation between the production budget and the profit?

In order to understand the effect of prdoduction budget, I plotted the scatter graphs for both profit and profit rate. Then, I have calculated the correlation for each distribution. The correlation values are displayed on the plots.
* As expected and observed on the plot (top), there is a high correlation between the production budget and profit.
* The correlation between production budget and profit rate is almost zero (bottom plot). The shape of the distribution varies in different budget ranges, the correlation might be different, too.  Therefore, it is better to look at the profit rate distributions in zoomed budget ranges. 

![Profit-vs-Budget](/images/figures_MovieBudget/budget-profit1.png)

The production budget is divided in 4 ranges, and scatter graphs are plotted for all. The median profit_rate is calculated and displayed on the graphs in addition to the correlation values.
* Low budget: production_budget <= $20,000,000 (top left): Almost zero correlation. Small median profit rate. Investment not recommended.
* Medium budget: $20,000,000 < production_budget <= $100,000,000 (top right): Almost zero correlation. Acceptable profit rate. Investment is recommended.
* High budget: $100,000,000 < production_budget <= $200,000,000 (bottom left): Some positive correlation exists. Good, stable profit rate. Highly recommended for investement.
* Very high budget: production_budget > $100,000,000 (bottom right): Negative correlation. Median profit rate is high. There is a likelihood that profit rate will decrease as the budget increases. The risk is high on this investment. The uncertinity in the analysis for this budget range is high due to the small data available.

### Q2: Is there a correlation between the ratings and the profit?

The below scatter plots show the profit versus average rating (top) and profit_rate versus average rating (bottom). There is good correlation between average rating and profit/profit_rate. However, after rating 8, the profit and profit rate drops. The left plot shows that, many high rating movies bring low profit, they are probably low budget movies. According to the right plot, the profit_rate is also low for the high rating movies. From profit point of view, I recommend to aim for making movies with average rating between 6 and 8.

### Q3: Which directors, writers, actors and actresses make the most profit?

For Business Questions 3 and 4, I have analyzed the movies in two seperate budget ranges:
* High budget: production_budget > $100,000,000

## Conclusion

Here are my business recommendations in movie making for the most profit:

* Invest on movies with production budget between $100,000,000 and $200,000,000.
* Aim for making movies with average rating between 6 and 8.
* Hire the listed directors, writers, actors and actresses for the movies in the recommended budget range. See Analysis and Result Section, Question 3.
* Invest on Sci-Fi, Animation, Thriller, Adventure movies for the recommended budget range.

The movies with medium production budget, $20,000,000 and $100,000,000, are acceptable for investment. For these movies, the profitable directors, writers, actors and actresses are different. The profitable genre for the medium budget range is also different than high budget range. Follow the budget specific recommendations in Analysis and Result Section, Question 3 an 4.


## Future Work

* Repeat the analysis in more budget ranges: $10,000,000 - $50,000,000 - $100,000 - $200,000,00 - up.
* Study the most profitable directors, actors, actresses and actors for each genre seperately.
* This study used the data of the movies after 1990. Repeat the study for the movies after 2000, even though it will cause the reduction of the entries and increase the standard deviation in the results.
